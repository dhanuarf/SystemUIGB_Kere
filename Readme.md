<h2> A fossil for Android 2.3</h2>

A rough and stupid-but-works implementation of various mods to SystemUI (status bar) on GT-S5360(specifically), but should work on all Samsung devices that runs Android 2.3(TouchWiz).

This SystemUI is based on Google AOSP 2.3 SystemUI.

Some mods:
* DSB **|kind of|*** by Paranoid Android (need to mod ScreenCaptureService.apk as well)
* Dynamic Music Album Art (change expanded view style following whats music currently playing)
* MaterialUI scrolling-like effect expanded view
* etc

Don't have the device anymore for testing and further improvement
